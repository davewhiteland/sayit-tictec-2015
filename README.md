Tool to prepare TICTeC15 keynote transcripts for SayIt
=============

Ended up here:
http://tictec2015.sayit.mysociety.org/

Actual process was:

* create SayIt instance
* create Akoma Ntoso XML versions of transcripts (this script)
* upload them using "Import Speeches"
* hand-edit the sections and speakers in SayIt (e.g., adding headshot URLs)

The two keynote transcripts are available as googledocs, this
was a script for turning them into importable AN XML.

Didn't get the timestamps right becuse they're mm:ss not hh:mm. Whoops.
