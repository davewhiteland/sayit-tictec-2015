=============

SayIt: http://sayit.mysociety.org/

TICTeC 2015: https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec2015/ 
 
The two keynote transcripts are available as googledocs, this
was a script for turning them into importable AN XML.

Didn't get the timestamps right becuse they're mm:ss not hh:mm. Whoops.
